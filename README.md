<h1 align="center">Welcome! I'm Nik Jensen</h1>
<h3 align="center">This repository collection showcases my academic work during my bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering at Utah State University. My studies focused on advancing technologies in LIDAR 3D mapping/imagery and GPS-Denied navigation for small Unmanned Aerial Systems using concepts of signal processing for geospatial applications.</h3>
